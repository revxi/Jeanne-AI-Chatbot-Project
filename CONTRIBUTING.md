## üõ† How to Contribute

### 1. Fork the repository
Click the **Fork** button on the top-right of the repository page on GitHub.

### 2. Clone your fork
Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Jeanne-AI-Chatbot-Project.git
cd Jeanne-AI-Chatbot-Project

### 4. Create a new branch
Always create a branch for your changes:

### 5. Make your changes
Follow the **project structure**:

- Frontend code goes into the `client/` folder (React + Vite)
- Backend code goes into the `server/` folder (Express + Node.js)
- Keep `.env` files private (do not commit them)

Test your changes locally:

```bash
# Start frontend and backend together
npm run dev
```

### 6. Commit your changes
Write a meaningful commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: description of your changes"
```

### 7. Keep your fork updated
Before pushing, fetch and rebase with upstream:

git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main
```

Resolve any conflicts if prompted.

### 8. Push and open a Pull Request
